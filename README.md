# Lambda CS MUD Game Backend

This is the backend of the Lambda MUD game. üéÆ

It is built with Python üêç, Django, a SQLite database in development and PostgreSQL database in production.

Multiple users can play the game simultaneously. Pusher is used to provide real-time communication üîà so players can communicate during the game and get information about the position of other players.

## Frontend üíª

The frontend is built with React and can be found [here](https://mud-mount-doom.herokuapp.com/)
